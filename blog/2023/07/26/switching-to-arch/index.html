            <br>
            <p>Yesterday I switched over to Arch Linux from Nobara Linux for some complicated reasons. The simple version is I was going to need to reinstall anyways, so I might as well see what all the talk is about.</p>

            <p>The initial insall went well, I used the archinstall script. But some problems arose post-instalation. One specific problem really. There was no sound.</p>
            <p>I spent several (5) hours on this issue, and eventually, when I was just about to give up and reinstall Nobara, I saw a forum post where someone listed the things that they had already tried and that had not solved their problems.</p>
            <p>In desperation, I decided to try the same things that they had said did not work, because they were new things that no other forum post had suggested. Incredibly, that solved my problem!</p>
            <p>The moral of the story is that when people say Arch is easy really, they are somewhat correct. Just don't have my specific soundcard.</p>
            <p>I'm also having some trouble with a few games, though they had been a struggle on Nobara as well, so I can't really blame that on Arch.</p>
