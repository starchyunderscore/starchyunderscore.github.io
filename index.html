            <p>Welcome to my webbed site. It is currently under construction and therefore may be missing some important peices. You can have a look around, but there isn't much content yet. I'm having trouble thinking of what I want to put.</p>
            <p>Perhaps some day I will think of something, but for now I'm just repeating myself to make sure that the css works correctly.</p>
            <p>I need a webpage long enough that you need to scroll to see the whole thing to make sure that the navigation bar works correctly and looks good, but I really cannot think of what I could possibly need to write on this page.</p>
            <p>So my solution, of course, is to put my complaining that I have nothing to put.</p>
            <p>Of course, that wasn't quite long enough, so I have progressed to repeating myself (when I say progressed, I do not mean progressed. I recognize that I have been repeating myself the whole time, but it's a long word and therefore accerates my progression towards my goal).</p>
            <p>I have just realized that a much simpler solution to my problem is to make my browser window smaller. No matter, I have already commited to this foolish task, and as well this method lets me test against all possible screen sizes, a great advantage.</p>
            <p>I will write this one last paragraph in the hopes of not needing to revisit this again, as waiting for github pages to deploy is boring.</p>
